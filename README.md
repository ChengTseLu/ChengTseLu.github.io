## Project Introduction
**Motivation**
Due to COVID-19 pandemic, there are more than 40 million confirmed cases, with 1 million people deaths attributed to the pandemic. COVID-19 spreads very easily through the air when an infected person or an asymptomatic infection breathes, coughs, talks, or sneezes. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that “people wear masks in public settings, like on public and mass transportation, at events and gatherings, and anywhere they will be around other people” and “masks may help prevent people who have COVID-19 from spreading the virus to others.” Therefore, having a system that can detect whether a person is wearing a mask and also measuring his/her body temperature at the same time could keep tracking people's health; furthermore, reduce the risk of being infected.

**Goal**
Incorporate deep learning algorithm for mask detection and use a thermal sensor to measure body temperature.

**Deliverable**
